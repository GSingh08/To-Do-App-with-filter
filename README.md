# HOMEWORK: To Do App with filtering!

Let's make a to do app, and let's add a filter bar up at the top.

## Here's your mission (in the form of user stories):

 - Users want to add items to the to do list
 - Users want to view items that have been added to the list
 - Users want to filter the to do list by typing in text to narrow down the to dos that are displayed

## BONUS

 - Users want to share individual to do items with friends (hint: each to do item will need its own url)

## SUPER BONUS

 - Users only want to see 10 items per page (hint: build in pagination)

## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due 🚨 11PM ON MONDAY NIGHT 🚨

- Go Blue! 〽️
